Hello and Thank You for trying Paper Launch!

First thing you've got to know to get this running. 

What is Paper Launch: Paper Launch is a generic Launcing Video game with 
a doodle theme. Similar Prgrams to doodle launch include Burrito Bison 
Toss The Turtle, Hedgehog Launch and Kitten Cannon. Its Hours of addictive
launching doodle fun! 


You need to make sure that pygame is installed on your computer in order for your
program to run. Once you got that module wise you are ready to go. 

All you need to do as far as images concern is just make sure that the paper launch
python file is contained in the same folder as the Paper Launch data Folder with the 
images and stuff in it. All you have to do is make sure that all of the images supplied 
are in the folder entiled "PaperLaunch" and you are good to go. The Progam will take care 
of the rest. It you want to use the Add Custom Background Feature you will need to 
put an image called "userbg" inside the folder literally anywhere in the folder and it will 
use your BG instead of the regular one. Just make sure that the file name is exactly as typed minus
the quotation marks and that the BG is higher than 800 pixels high. The Program will take care of the
rest. You will need to restart the program if it is already running.
