Hello! and Thank You for trying Paper Launch!

This is my first major Python project written as my term project for the class 15112 at Carnegie Mellon University.

Paper Launch is a generic launching game with a doodle theme. Similar programs to paper launch include Burrito Bison Toss The Turtle, Hedgehog Launch and Kitten Cannon. It's hours of addictive launching doodle fun! 

All navigation is done with the arrow keys and enter button.

You need to make sure that pygame is installed on your computer in order for the program to run.

Make sure that the Paper Launch python file is contained in the same folder as the 
Paper Launch Data Folder.The Progam will take care of the rest. It you want to use the add a Custom Background, you will need to put an image called "userbg" inside the "PaperLaunchData" folder literally anywhere, and it will use your BG instead of the regular one. Just make sure that the BG you have entered is 800px high. You will need to restart the program if it is already running. 


Have Fun!
